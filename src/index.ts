/**
 * WorkBuddy models for DeepSeek Harness, reusing the WorkBuddy desktop apps'
 * sign-in. Registers one provider per product variant — `workbuddy` for the CN
 * app and `workbuddy-ai` for the international one — while streaming, tool
 * calls, compaction, and permissions stay Harness-owned.
 *
 * The two variants are assembled by the same factory and differ only in their
 * {@link WorkBuddyVariant} descriptor: each gets its own credential store,
 * catalog, upstream client, shim, adapter, probe state, and routes. Neither
 * variant's startup, catalog fetch, or credential state can stop the other from
 * registering — a user with only one app installed sees only that group.

   *   instead of starting its own (spec §5: one catalog request per variant at
   *   a time).
   * - **Generation-checked write-back.** The request records the generation it
   *   started under and writes nothing if the generation moved on — which is
   *   what a slow answer from a superseded account must not do. Checking only
   *   the *identity* was not enough: two refreshes for the same account can
   *   still finish out of order, and the older one would win.
   * - **`resolve()`, not `current()`.** Only `resolve()` performs the locked,
   *   single-flight token renewal. Reading `current()` meant an expired token
   *   made every catalog request fail until something else happened to refresh
