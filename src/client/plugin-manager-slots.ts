/**
 * SlotMap merge for the plugin manager's bundle-configuration seat — a
 * structural re-statement of the contract
 * `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-plugin-manager` declares for its Plugins page
 * (its `slot-contract.ts`): the sidebar's Plugins panel renders one bundle's
 * own configuration ON THE BUNDLE'S DETAIL PAGE — the page a plugin card opens
 * into — through the `plugins.bundle.config` keyed slot, keyed by the bundle's
 * npm package name, between the page's description and its component rows
 * (`view: 'page'` only).
 *
 * The package is a Host built-in this bundle does not depend on (client bundle
 * purity: cross-plugin collaboration goes through services and slots, never
 * imports), so the seat is re-declared here to make the registration
 * type-check. The declaration must stay STRUCTURALLY IDENTICAL to upstream's:
 * when a peer package ships its own merge, a duplicate conflicting member would
 * fail compilation — the guard against drift. The owner shapes below are
 * upstream's `PluginConfigViewProps` / `ConfigPageForm` verbatim, with the
 * `ConfigForm` types imported from the settings client package this bundle
 * depends on (the same source upstream imports them from).
